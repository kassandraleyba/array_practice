How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Somewhat confident. 

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I need more practice with different scenarios and methods.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
music_genre = ["Rock", "Indie", "Jazz", "Lofi"]
music_genre.pop
puts music_genre

number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
puts number.shuffle

I don't understand why the number example didn't need the extra step
compared to the music_genre array.
I ran it multiple times in ruby and it seemed to work!
Also, can you add multiple methods to one array?
