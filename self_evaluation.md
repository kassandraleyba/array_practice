How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
- Somewhat confident. 

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
- I need more practice with different scenarios and methods.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
- music_genre = ["Rock", "Indie", "Jazz", "Lofi"] </br>
  music_genre.pop </br>
  puts music_genre

  number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </br>
  puts number.shuffle

  I don't understand why the number array didn't need the extra step compared to the music_genre array. </br>
  I ran it multiple times in ruby and it seemed to work! </br>
  Also, can you add multiple methods to one array?
